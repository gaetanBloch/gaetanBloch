<h2>Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></h2>

<h3>Glad to see you here!</h3>

<p>
I'm passionate about Full Stack / DevOps Engineering ðŸ’». I enjoy working on the Back End as much as on the Front End parts. I also have a great interest in the CI / CD and DevOps Infrastructures. QA is one of the most important parts of the Software development lifecycle, and as such, I make it a priority in terms of Tests (Unit, Integration, End-to-End, etc.) and the use of diverse QA tools.

I have more than 10 years of professional experience and my most significant project was in a Tokyo-based ðŸ—¼ DSI for 5 years as a Full Stack Engineer in the context of Big Data, Microservices, and Distributed Systems.
